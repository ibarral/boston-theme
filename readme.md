You can insert any WordPress widgets into the right drawer of the theme.

### Internationalization ###

Boston theme supports English and Spanish internationalization.

### Information for developers ###

Boston was built using Compass and SASS.
The syntax is SCSS and it has a built in function to create all units in relation to ems.
This allows the responsiveness of the theme to be graceful in relation to the content.
